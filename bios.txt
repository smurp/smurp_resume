Shawn Murphy is a software architect, knowledge engineer, software
developer, development team leader, programming coach and trainer.
Working in government, industry and academia he has designed and built
large data-driven scientific, bibliographic, medical, collaborative,
e-commerce and publishing systems.

Now, as founder of Nooron Collaboratory [ http://nooron.com ] he is
developing general purpose ontologically-driven software to support
collective cognitive workflows such as knowledge management; evidence
capture; candidate comparison; criterion elicitation; worldivew
articulation; sense-making; decision support; knowledge visualization;
rapid, semantic application development and user-contributable
everything.

It is in this context that Shawn has been developing HuViz -- a scriptable,
interactive semantic visualization, navigation and (soon) authoring
component.  This work has been conducted in close cooperation with, and
supported by, the Orlando Project [ http://www.artsrn.ualberta.ca/orlando/ ]
and, more recently, the Canadian Writers Reseach Collaboratory [ https://cwrc.ca/ ]

Shawn's mission is to ensure that our software tools for discovering,
thinking, deciding and acting can co-evolve under the pressure of
ever-improving best practices on the theory that this is the "level of
thinking" required for us to meet the challenges of our time.

* Databases store what we think we know but academics need to manage the
  very process by which we establish that knowning -- through learning,
  debate and the evaluation of evidence and opinion.
