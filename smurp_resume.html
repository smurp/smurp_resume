<h1 id="introduction">Introduction:</h1>
<p>Shawn Murphy is a software architect, knowledge engineer, software developer, development team leader, programming coach and trainer with 30+ years of professional experience. He designs and builds large data-driven, scientific, academic, collaborative, e-commerce and publishing systems. He is fluent in diverse programming languages, knowledge representation technologies, frameworks, visualization tools, RDBMSes, ORMs, APIs, standards, methodologies and architectural styles.</p>
<p>Examples of his work include: a vehicle fleet tracking system with RESTful API; multiple dynamic knowledge visualization systems; a custom database publishing system used by the largest real estate markets in Western Canada; real-estate systems powered by his own RETS implementation; a large bibliographic collaboration system seeded with Library of Congress data; a Laboratory Information Management System for disease diagnosis which captured, processed and reported on disparate scientific data streams; recruiting management systems; numerous B2B and B2C e-commerce technologies and systems (handling both digital and tangible goods); and many other projects involving sophisticated data-sets and processing.</p>
<p>Inspired by emergent phenomena and self-organizing systems, he is focused on exploiting knowledge representation, collaborative filtering, evolutionary pressure and mass customization strategies for building out a global-scale knowledge management eco-system wherein software, knowledge and presentation co-evolve under the pressure of human opinion –– in short, technologically grounding our collective intelligence, so we can meet the challenges of our time.</p>
