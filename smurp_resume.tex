\section{Experience:}

\title{ Principal }
\location{Edmonton, AB}
\employer{smurp.com} 
\dates{2002 to Present}

\begin{position}
Shawn has been performing various contract programming and consulting jobs
and working on a large open source project called Nooron.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Nooron --- Nooron aims to be an online digital ecosystem in
    which knowledge, logic and presentation can all evolve under the
    pressure of fine-grained, criterion-based collaborative filtering 
    and be syndicated across a globe-spanning, self-organizing, 
    peer to peer system of web servers and client machines.
    Nooron is Free Software under the GPL.

    It currently has applications supporting:
       \begin{itemize}
          \item project management
	  \item pattern languages
          \item blogging
          \item FAQs
       \end{itemize}
     It automatically publishes knowledge contained in it and also
     knowledge about itself in various textual and graphical forms:
       \begin{itemize}
          \item DocBook, Rich Text, SVG, GIF, JPG, PDF and Postscript
	  \item UML diagrams
          \item state-transition-diagrams
          \item network graphs
          \item inheritance trees
          \item PERT charts
       \end{itemize}

  \item PyOKBC --- A Python implementation of the Open KnowledgeBase
  Connectivity system of knowledge representation and abstraction.  It
  provides a single consistent interface to diverse structured
  information sources, eventually including ontologies, relational databases,
  xml documents, and topic maps.  PyOKBC is Free Software under the LGPL.

  \item CatPub --- A database publishing technology consisting of a
  Postscript templating system over a relational database back-end.
  Suitable for automatically preparing complex, highly customized,
  Postscript and PDF publications such as directories and catalogs,
  it is closed source software created under contract for a firm
  providing publishing services to the real estate industry.  
  It is producing on the order of 10 thousand unique catalog pages 
  every day containing constantly changing data for all of the largest 
  real estate boards in Western Canada.

  \item TKQ2.0 --- A Django e-store system vending e-books for hundreds
  of educational publishers, through a dozen store-fronts, with sophisticated 
  features such as promotions, steganographic watermarking in PDF, bundling,
  ``digital drop shipping`` and more.

  \item ModelViz --- Added dynamic SVG-based touring facilities to this Django
 model entity-relationship visualizer.

  \item A Django-based lodgings database backing a web site, a printed directory and an associated advertising sales and layout system.

\end{itemize}
