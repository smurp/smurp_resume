\section{Introduction:}
\begin{par}

Shawn Murphy is a software architect, knowledge engineer,
software developer, development team leader, programming coach
and trainer.
He designs and builds large data-driven, scientific, academic, 
collaborative, e-commerce and publishing systems. 
He is fluent in diverse programming languages, knowledge
representation technologies, frameworks, visualization tools, RDBMSes,
ORMs, APIs, standards, methodologies and architectural styles. 
Examples of his work include:
  a custom database publishing system used by the largest real estate
    markets in Western Canada;
  real-estate systems powered by his own RETS implementation; 
  a large bibliographic collaboration system seeded with Library of Congress data; 
  a Laboratory Information Management System for disease diagnosis which 
    captured, processed and reported on disparate scientific data streams; 
  numerous B2B and B2C e-commerce technologies and systems 
    (handling both digital and tangible goods);
  and many other projects involving sophisticated data-sets and processing. 
Inspired by emergent phenomena and
self-organizing systems, he is focused on exploiting knowledge
representation, collaborative filtering, evolutionary pressure and
mass customization strategies for building out a global-scale
knowledge management eco-system wherein software, knowledge and presentation
co-evolve under the pressure of human opinion --â€“ in short, a framework for 
thinking together better, so we can meet the challenges of our time.
