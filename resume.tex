%%% RESUME Library                      Created by KMP@MC -- Feb/Mar 1980
%%%    Converted for TEX from TEX80 by PARKER@OZ and MARC@OZ -- June 1985 
%%%       Extended with NEWSECTION by MARKUS@OZ and PARKER@OZ -- Jan 1986 
%%%
%%% Please notify PARKER@OZ of any changes to this file.
%%%
%%% This is a library for creating cookbook resumes. Everything is here.
%%% All you add are the lies about yourself.
%%%
%%% For a sample usage, see the file TEXLOCAL:RESUME-SAMPLE.TEX
%%% See the file TEXLOCAL:RESUME.CONVERSION for information on
%%%   converting your old TeX resume to run under the new system.
%%%
%%% Note:  Currently you must run TeX using this package by doing:
%%%                @TEXTR <resume filename>
%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% If things go wrong using this file, here are some common problems.
%%% If all else fails, send me (PARKER@OZ) mail and maybe we can fix it.
%%%
%%% Debugging help:
%%%                ******THIS IS CRITICAL*******
%%%  -- look at arglist, esp. for twocol, split, and newsection.  If there is a
%%%     space between the args (such as #1 and #2), then there must be
%%%     one in the source.
%%%                ******END CRITICAL SECTION****
%%%  -- if you get black vertical bars on your output, that means that
%%%     a line was overfull.  Often the reason for this is the
%%%     width of the page (pagewidth) is not big enough to contain
%%%     both the section label and the value you specified for
%%%     textwidth.  Adjust these numbers and all should work.
%%%     Be sure that if you have a big label name, you use twoline
%%%     to split it to two lines.
%%%  -- if you get a vertical overfull box problem and you have a one-line
%%%     objective, you will need to put \vskip .125in
%%%     in the format section at the end of your resume just after the
%%%     line \objective and just before the next one.  You may still
%%%     get a warning from TeX about this box, but you will not have
%%%     any crowding on your output.
%%%     A possibly easier way of doing this is to make your objective
%%%     look like this:
%%%     \defsection{\objective}{\twoline {Employment}{Objective}}
%%%         {\text {This is my short objective.}
%%%         \text { }}
%%%     This blank text box will fake TeX into giving you the space you
%%%     need AND you won't get any warnings.
%%%  -- If you get font problems, try using the defaults and running
%%%     TeX using TEXTR, which uses the Times Roman font family.

%%% \defsection{macroname}{sectionname}
%%%     {main text of section}
%%%
%%% This macro allows you to define a macro named macroname which can be
%%% called later and which will produce a box which looks like
%%%
%%%    sectionname ... text ........
%%%                ... more text ...
%%%                ... etc .........
%%%
%%% The text of section must be constructed in turn by the use of either
%%% of two special operators.
%%%
%%% \text{...}          means that the text in the box is to be set as a 
%%%                     normal paragraph
%%%
%%% \split{...} {...}   means that the two boxes are to be set on a single
%%%                     line separated by whitespace. The first box is in
%%%                     9pt bold by default, the second is 8pt roman.
%%%
%%% A sample section definition looks like:
%%%
%%% \defsection{\education} {Education}
%%%   {\split{Massachusetts Institute of Technology} {Cambridge, MA}
%%%    \text {Got a Bachelor of Science in Humanities. Didn't learn much.}
%%%    \space

%%% NEWSECTION -- allows you to produce output with year labels, for instance,
%%%    to the right of each of your jobs.  An alternative to putting the
%%%    year information inside the job description.               
%%% 
%%% This NEWSECTION by Markus Toth (MARKUS@OZ).
%%%
%%% Example of what the source code should look like:
%%%
%%%\defnewsection{\work}{Experience}
%%%   {\skip
%%%    \seclayer{\twoline {1985 to} {Present}}
%%%       {\split{Company A, Inc.}              {Nowhere, MA}
%%%        \text {As director of food consumption....}}
%%%    \skip
%%%    \seclayer{\twoline {1982 to} {1985}}
%%%       {\split{Company B, Ltd.}              {Somewhere, MA}
%%%        \text {Associate Research Scientist.  ....}}
%%%    \vskip 0pt}}   %% THIS MUST BE HERE
%%%
%%% And here is the output produced by that:
%%%
%%% Experience
%%%
%%% 1985 to          Company A, Inc                Nowhere, MA
%%% Present          As director of food consumption...

%%% 1985             Associate Research Scientist.  ....
%%%
%%% Note that the \vskip 0pt at the end of \defnewsection is CRITICAL.

%%% \format{addresslist}
%%%        {bodylist}
%%%
%%% This is what defines how things get laid out. Just list out your

%%%
%%%  \format{\home\space\work\space\permanent}
%%%         {\objective\skip\education\skip\background}
%%%
%%% This will define a \copy and that will make it get output. You may
%%% change fonts, etc, between doing \copy's and the changes will affect
%%% subsequent \copy commands. You'll need to supply your own \bye at
